## Purpose

No matter how heavy the tree is to build/layout, it will run at (roughly) full FPS, feel smooth, has zero uncomfortable janks, with neglitable overhead. (Detailed reports [here](benchmark))

## Usage

Two possibilities:

* **Drop-in replacements**: For common scenarios, add 6 characters ("Smooth") - `ListView` becomes [`SmoothListView`](https://fzyzcjy.github.io/flutter_smooth/usage/drop-in), ``MaterialPageRoute`` becomes [`SmoothMaterialPageRoute`](https://fzyzcjy.github.io/flutter_smooth/usage/drop-in).

* **Arbitrarily flexible builder**: For complex cases, use [`SmoothBuilder(builder: ...)`](https://fzyzcjy.github.io/flutter_smooth/usage/builder) and put whatever you want to be smooth inside the `builder`.

## Status

* The infra part is already implemented (hard, took me a month). The drop-in part and demo, which is mainly engineering work utilizing the exposed infra API, still has many improveable things - feel free to issue and PR!
* Need to wait for all PRs to Flutter to be merged and next Flutter release. (PR status [here](https://fzyzcjy.github.io/flutter_smooth/insight/status))

## Thanks

* [@Hixie](https://github.com/Hixie) (Flutter team): Consider details of my several proposals to the Flutter framework/engine such as requiring zero-overhead principle. Construct concrete cases when the initial proposal becomes fragile.
* [@dnfield](https://github.com/dnfield) (Flutter team): Provide a canonical janky case inside Flutter framework to help prototyping. Point out slowness of sync generators which avoids detouring.
* [@jonahwilliams](https://github.com/jonahwilliams) (Flutter team): Elaborate shortcomings of the old gesture system proposal (later I made a much more natural one).
* [@gaaclarke](https://github.com/gaaclarke) (Flutter team): Share his pet theory that slowness is caused by memory locality, indicating another potential application of the package.
