To begin with, let us define "latency" as the number of frames it takes from starting drawing frame to ending rasterization.

However, at 50.00ms, both the content from frame b and frame c wants to be displayed to screen, so frame b will never be shown and only frame c is shown. If it is a linear moving animation with 1px per millisecond, we will see offset being 0 (frame a) at 33.33ms and offset being 33.33px (frame c) at 50.00ms, while we know all other frames will introduce an offset of 16.67px per frame.
