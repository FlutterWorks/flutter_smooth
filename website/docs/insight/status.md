:::caution

Many PRs are labeled **rejected** below, but it does not mean they are really rejected. Instead, it is because "closing to remove from review queues" ([source](https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/36917#issuecomment-1294120439)). I am re-submitting refined version after working towards the code review feedbacks, as well as having further discussions in Discord with Flutter team which they suggest.
