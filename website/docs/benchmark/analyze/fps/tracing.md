# Result from tracing

## Methods

Count the number of `Jank(ZeroRasterEndInVsyncInterval)` synthesized events (generated by my  script).

Alternatively, manually look at each and every vsync interval. If there is no `GPURasterizer::Draw` ending in that interval, we will observe one jank.

## Results

Well, for this tracing data, zero jank happens (no "Jank" in the following screenshot). So it is exactly **60FPS**.

However, it is definitely not always the case. For example, we have seen in the [video](video.md) section that it is only ~58FPS. As discussed there, this can be caused by bugs of this package, and/or other factors unrelated to build/layout slowness. Moreover, I suspect the good data here is because, in order to keep the tracing file small in git repo, I choose to record the first scroll; however, in that section, it is (for example) 10th scroll. Therefore, I guess GC pressure will be much larger there. Anyway, these two are only samples - if you see a problem in *real world*, don't hesitate to submit an issue and discuss!

### Example: How does a jank look like

Luckily, there is [a bug](LargeLatency_PreemptRender) that I have not fixed, and it affects the time range 2800ms-3400ms, which is indeed the time before the main scrolling happens, causing a jank (and a lot of `LargeLatency_PreemptRender` warning). So we can have a look how a jank looks like here.

Look at the figure below, we see a `Jank(ZeroRasterEndInVsyncInterval)` in the 2938-2955ms frame. Clearly, during these 16.67ms, there is no ending of `GPURasterizer::Draw`. In other words, no content is provided to the screen, so we will have a jank.

(May discuss `LargeLatency_PreemptRender` which is a good hint of implementation and usage bugs later)
