# Latency

definition
e.g. originally need 1s to load the new page, now need 1.01s, then overhead is 1%

why
p.s. if not considering latency, then "do a *tiny* bit of thing per frame" will be quite great.

TODO also, is it really "overhead", or "necessary things"

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
