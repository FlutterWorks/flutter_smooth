TODO: show my experiment setup, especially which phone I use to test.
Also mention it is 200x slower than iphone 6s in ReportTimings to have a rough feeling about its speed.

TODO: analyze from video

TODO: analyze from timeline + my script

TODO: when latency=1->2/2->1, user also feels jank, but many FPS calculation methods do not realize this (#6114)

TODO: common mistake - "average = 16.68ms" means 30FPS not 59FPS. even devtool is wrong.
