title: Devtool
---

Explain that we cannot view the (computed) metrics of devtool, since

1. We disabled timing report to speed up a bit
2. It does not understand our "one-beginframe-multi-render" scheme
3. It is inaccurate, https://github.com/flutter/devtools/issues/4522

Instead, use the script (or create your script) on the timeline, or look at video, or look at timeline manually
