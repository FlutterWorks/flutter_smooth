# Benchmark

In this chapter, I will show:

1. How are my benchmarks conducted?
2. What metrics are interesting, and how are they analyzed?
3. What are the benchmark results on my (super-slow) test device?

Let's get started:

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
